Note:
1. YOU SHOULD DO WEB-SEARCHING TO FIND THE COMMANDS FOR THE FUZZERS
2. YOU SHOULD LOOK FOR THE FUZZER IN THE DIRECTORY FIRST
3. IF YOU ARE LACK OF SOME DEPENDENCIES, YOU SHOULD INSTALL THEM FIRST
4. YOU SHOULD AVOID THE FOLLOWING ERROR AGAIN:
    Status: Failed - Fuzzer consistently terminated due to Out-Of-Memory errors. The memory limit appears fixed at 2048MB and could not be increased using standard LibFuzzer flags (`-rss_limit_mb`) or ASan environment variables (`ASAN_OPTIONS=hard_rss_limit_mb`). Attempts to reduce memory usage via fuzzer parameters (`-len_control`, `-mutate_depth`, `-malloc_limit_mb`) were also unsuccessful. Fuzzing cannot proceed under the current memory constraints. An OOM-triggering artifact was saved in `libfuzzer_artifacts/`.
    YOU SHOULD NOT USE THE ASAN ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES OR the `-rss_limit_mb` FLAG 
5. IF YOU ENCOUNTER ANY ISSUES, YOU SHOULD FIND THE SOLUTION FROM THE WEB ANF TRY TO FIX IT
6. IF YOU ENCOUNTER  LibFuzzer OOM errors, you should try to reduce the memory usage via fuzzer parameters (`-len_control`, `-mutate_depth`, `-malloc_limit_mb`) and then try to fix it.
7. IF YOU KEEP ENCOUNTERING THE LibFuzzer OOM errors, you should FIND THE WAY TO DEAL WITH IT FROM THE WEB
8. YOU SHOULD NOT USE -rss_limit_mb or ASAN TO SOLVE THE OOM ERROR, SO YOU SHOULD FIND THE WAY TO SOLVE IT FROM THE WEB
9. **Practical fixes for jhead OOM / QEMU issues**  
    - Prefer **LibFuzzer low-memory** flags:  
    `-malloc_limit_mb=256 -max_len=4096 -len_control=0 -mutate_depth=2`  
    - Build **without ASan** to cut memory: use `-fsanitize=fuzzer` only.  
    - For AFL++, avoid QEMU: rebuild jhead with `CC=afl-clang-fast`, then  
    run classic mode `afl-fuzz -i seeds -o out -- ./jhead_afl @@`.

# Define action prompt
Action_prompt = """
* `Use_Command`: Executes a shell command.
  - Format: `Action_Input: ##<command>##`
  - Example: `Action_Input: ##ls -l##`
  NOTE: Take this action when you need to run bash commands. The command has a {COMMAND_TIMEOUT} (if zero there is no timeout) second timeout, so make sure it will not take too long to run.

* `Observe_Terminal`: Observes real-time fuzzer execution output.
  - Format: `Action_Input: ##OBSERVATE##`
  - Use this to **extract fuzzer logs, coverage stats, and error messages**.

* `Run_Fuzzer`: Launch a fuzzer (e.g., LibFuzzer, AFL++) against the built binary.
  - If the fuzzer terminates early with a crash (e.g., AddressSanitizer reports a heap-buffer-overflow), YOU MUST NOT stop.
  - Instead:
    - If using LibFuzzer, restart it with `-fork=1 -ignore_crashes=1`.
    - If LibFuzzer still fails, rebuild the target WITHOUT ASan (only `-fsanitize=fuzzer`).
    - If unable to continue, you may switch to a different fuzzer (e.g., AFL++).
  - Always log the crash details and the input that caused it.

* `Check_Fuzzer`: Monitor the running fuzzer’s performance using internal tools (`read_latest_tui_output()`).
  - Wait ≥7 seconds after starting the fuzzer before first check.
  - Report metrics such as execution speed, paths found, and crashes detected.

* `Adjust_Fuzzer`: Adjust fuzzer parameters based on performance or crash situations.
  - Examples:
    - Add flags: `-fork=1 -ignore_crashes=1`
    - Rebuild target without ASan
    - Switch input corpus, dictionary, or fuzzer engine.
    
* `Respond_to_Human`: Logs final execution results.

# Define a demonstration to help the agent understand its role
Demonstration = """
Here is a demonstration of how to correctly execute, monitor, and optimize fuzzers.

--- DEMONSTRATION ---

## 1. Running the Fuzzer
### AFLplusplus:
   - Command: `/afl-fuzz -i seeds -o output -- ./target_binary`
   - This command starts fuzzing using input seeds and writes results to `output`.

### Honggfuzz:
   - Command: `honggfuzz -i seeds -o output -- ./target_binary`
   - Similar to AFL++, but Honggfuzz **automatically detects optimal settings**.

### LibFuzzer:
   - Command: `./target_binary -runs=1000`
   - Runs **1,000 fuzzing iterations** on the binary.

## 2. Monitoring the Fuzzer
### AFLplusplus:
   - Command: `afl-whatsup output`
   - Extracts statistics on fuzzing performance, execution speed, and crashes.

### Honggfuzz:
   - Command: `tail -f output/honggfuzz.log`
   - Monitors **real-time logs** from the fuzzing process.

### LibFuzzer:
   - Command: `grep "cov:" output.log`
   - Extracts **coverage statistics** from LibFuzzer's log file.

## 3. Adjusting the Fuzzer for Optimization
### AFLplusplus:
   - If execution is slow, increase memory:
     ```
     kill -SIGSTOP <pid> && afl-fuzz -m 8G -t 2000+
     ```
   - This stops the current run, then **restarts** it with more memory (`-m 8G`) and longer timeout (`-t 2000+`).

### Honggfuzz:
   - Increase thread count for faster execution:
     ```
     honggfuzz -n 4 -i seeds -o output -- ./target_binary
     ```
   - The `-n 4` flag enables **multi-threaded fuzzing**.

### LibFuzzer:
   - If crashes are minimal, increase mutation depth:
     ```
     ./target_binary -runs=5000 -max_len=1024
     ```
   - This **increases the number of fuzzing iterations** and **allows longer inputs**.

## 4. Logging and Reporting
   - Collect results in proper format:
     ```
     Execution Report:
     Fuzzer: AFLplusplus
     Binary: /home/user/target_binary
     Execution Time: 3h 24m
     Crashes Found: 5
     Coverage Gained: 78.5%
     ```
--- END OF DEMONSTRATION ---
"""

# Define instant prompt for task execution
Instant_prompt = """
YOUR TASKS:
1. **Execute the fuzzer** on the target binary in `{working_dir}`.
2. **Ensure all necessary dependencies are installed** before execution.
3. **Monitor** the execution and **log all performance data**.
4. If performance is **not optimal**, **adjust the settings or restart the fuzzer** with better parameters.
5. **Respond only when execution is successful**, logging:
   - Execution Time
   - Code Coverage
   - Number of Crashes Found
6.- When running the fuzzer, if an immediate crash (such as an AddressSanitizer error) is detected:
  1. Record the crash and input file.
  2. Attempt to continue fuzzing using one or more strategies:
     - Restart the fuzzer with `-fork=1 -ignore_crashes=1`.
     - Rebuild the target WITHOUT AddressSanitizer but WITH fuzzer instrumentation.
     - If the current fuzzer cannot continue, switch to a different fuzzer (e.g., AFL++).
  3. Your goal is to maintain the fuzzing session and gather as much coverage and crash data as possible.



NOTICE:
- **Check the README file** in the fuzzer's directory before execution.
- If unsure of execution arguments, run `-help` for guidance.
- **DO NOT edit source code**—only modify execution settings.
- **DO NOT stop fuzzers unless performance is clearly suboptimal**.
- **Check the directory and find the fuzzer before execution**
- **Use the fuzzer existed in the directory first**.
- You should not stop fuzzing after finding a single crash unless explicitly instructed.
- Only use `Summarize_Agent` when you have exhausted all continuation strategies.
